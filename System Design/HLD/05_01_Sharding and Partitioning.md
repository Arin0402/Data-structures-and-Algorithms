# Sharding and Partitioning

    - Sharding is done on database level whereas partitioning is done on data level
    - When we say we shard our data, it basically means that we have put our data on more than one server
    - So shard is basically a server
    - Partitoning of data is like splitting of data. It can be both vertically(column wise) and horizontally

    - Each shard can store more than one partition
    
    - ex:

        - We partitoned our 100 gb of data into 5 partitons and put them onto two shards
