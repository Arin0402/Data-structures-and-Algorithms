# What is System design

    - System design is the process of planning how different parts of a software system will work together to build a complete, efficient, and scalable application.

    - It includes decisions like how users interact with the system, how data flows, what components are needed, and how to handle large traffic, failures, or security.

    - To optimise the process and increase the troughput through the same resource

    - Keeping backups and avoiding single point of failures

    - How adaptable, fault tolerant, resilient, scalable, available the system is.
