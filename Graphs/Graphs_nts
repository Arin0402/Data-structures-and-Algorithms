1. A node can not appear twice in the path.
2. All trees are graph.
3. Graph containing single cycle is known cyclic graph.
4. a directed graph containing no cycles is known as Directed Acyclic graph( DAG)
5. Total degree of undirected graph = 2*E (no. of edges)
6. Degree of node in undirected graph  = number of edges connected to it.
8. maximum number of edges a DAG can have as n(n−1)2.
7. Topological sort is only valid in DAG.
8. Dijkstra's algo do not work for graph with negative edges. We use Bellman Ford Algo for that.
9. Bellman ford works for directed graph. In case of undirected graphs, they are converted to directed graphs first.
10. Bellman ford does not work if there is negative cycle in graph. It detects negative cycle in graph
11. Floyd Warshall finds the minimum distance for each vertex to other vertexes.
12. Floyd Warshall works for negative edge but no negative cycle, whereas Dijkstra’s algorithm don’t work for negative edges.
13. Kosa Raju's alog is used to find the number of connected components in a graph.
14. For Eulerian graph , all the veritces should have even degree.
15. For Semi Eulerian graph , two veritces should have odd degree and rest should have even degree.
16. For Eulerian path , either all the veritces should have even degree or two veritces should have odd degree and rest should have even degree.
