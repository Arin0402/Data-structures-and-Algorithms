### Difference b/w hashmap, hashtable, linkedhashmap & treemap

`HashMap`, `Hashtable`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `TreeMap` are all implementations of the `Map` interface in Java, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:

1.  **HashMap**:

    - **Thread-Safety:** Not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a `HashMap` concurrently and at least one of the threads modifies it structurally, it must be synchronized externally.
    - **Order:** Does not guarantee any specific order of the elements. Iteration order may vary between different runs.
    - **Null Keys and Values:** Allows one null key and multiple null values.
    - **Performance:** Offers good performance for most use cases.
    - **Underlying Data Structure:** Uses a hash table for storage.

2.  **Hashtable**:

    - **Thread-Safety:** Thread-safe. All methods are synchronized, so it can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment.
    - **Order:** Does not guarantee any specific order of elements. Iteration order may vary between different runs.
    - **Null Keys and Values:** Does not allow null keys or values.
    - **Performance:** Slower than `HashMap` due to synchronization overhead.
    - **Underlying Data Structure:** Also uses a hash table for storage.

3.  **LinkedHashMap**:

    - **Thread-Safety:** Not thread-safe by default, but can be made thread-safe by wrapping it using `Collections.synchronizedMap()`.
    - **Order:** Maintains insertion order. Iteration order is the order in which elements were added.
    - **Null Keys and Values:** Allows one null key and multiple null values.
    - **Performance:** Offers good performance, similar to `HashMap`, while preserving insertion order.
    - **Underlying Data Structure:** Combines a hash table with a doubly-linked list to maintain order.

    LinkedHashMap<KeyType, ValueType> linkedHashMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();

4.  **TreeMap**:

    - **Thread-Safety:** Not thread-safe. Like `HashMap`, it needs external synchronization for concurrent access.
    - **Order:** Maintains natural order or a specified order based on a comparator. Elements are sorted.
    - **Null Keys and Values:** `Does not allow null keys` but allows null values.
    - **Performance:** Slower than `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap`, especially for large data sets, due to sorting overhead.
    - **Underlying Data Structure:** Uses a red-black tree for storage, which ensures elements are sorted.

    import java.util.TreeMap;

        public class TreeMapExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                TreeMap<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();

                // Adding elements
                treeMap.put("One", 1);
                treeMap.put("Three", 3);
                treeMap.put("Two", 2);

                // Accessing elements
                int value = treeMap.get("Two");
                System.out.println("Value of 'Two': " + value);

                // Iterating through elements
                for (String key : treeMap.keySet()) {
                    int val = treeMap.get(key);
                    System.out.println(key + ": " + val);
                }
            }
        }

        This code creates a TreeMap with string keys and integer values, adds elements, accesses them, and iterates through the key-value pairs. Note that the elements are automatically sorted in ascending order of keys.

    In summary, the choice of which map implementation to use depends on your specific requirements:

- If you need thread safety, consider `Hashtable`.
- If you want a basic, unsynchronized map with good performance, use `HashMap`.
- If you need to maintain insertion order, consider `LinkedHashMap`.
- If you need a sorted map, use `TreeMap`.

Keep in mind that for thread-safe operations on `HashMap`, you can use `Collections.synchronizedMap()` to wrap it and make it thread-safe, but this may have a performance impact.

### Difference between hashmap and ConcurrentHashMap - will the hashmap fail in a multithreaded environment or what is It. If it does not then at what point will it create the fail fast exception

`HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` are both implementations of the `Map` interface in Java, but they handle thread safety differently in a multithreaded environment.

**1. ** **HashMap:**

- **Thread Safety:** `HashMap` is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a `HashMap` concurrently and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally (i.e., adding or removing elements), it must be synchronized externally to avoid concurrent modification exceptions.
- **Fail-Fast Behavior:** If a `HashMap` is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own `remove()` method, a `ConcurrentModificationException` will be thrown. This is known as fail-fast behavior and indicates that the map has been modified during iteration, which might cause unpredictable behavior.

**2. ** **ConcurrentHashMap:**

- **Thread Safety:** `ConcurrentHashMap` is designed to be thread-safe without requiring external synchronization. It achieves this by dividing the map into segments, allowing multiple threads to operate on different segments concurrently without interfering with each other.
- **Fail-Safe Iterators:** Iterators returned by `ConcurrentHashMap` are weakly consistent. They will never throw `ConcurrentModificationException` even if the map is modified during iteration. Instead, they might not reflect the most recent changes.

In a `HashMap`, if one thread is iterating over the map while another modifies it structurally (adding, removing elements), a `ConcurrentModificationException` will be thrown at the point of modification.

In contrast, a `ConcurrentHashMap` would not throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` in this situation, but it might not reflect the most recent changes made after the iterator was created. It's important to note that while `ConcurrentHashMap` provides thread safety for individual operations, compound actions (like iterating over the map) still require external synchronization if you need a consistent view of the data.

### so i have created an iterator on one thread but not iterating over it and on another thread I am modifying the hashmap will exception be thrown ?

If you have created an iterator on one thread but have not started iterating over it, and on another thread you are modifying the HashMap, it will not throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`. The `ConcurrentModificationException` is specifically related to concurrent modification during active iteration. In your described scenario, where the iterator has not yet started iterating, there is no concurrent modification during iteration, and thus no exception will be thrown.

However, please note that while you won't encounter a `ConcurrentModificationException`, you still need to be cautious about potential data inconsistencies or unexpected behavior if one thread is modifying the HashMap while another thread is concurrently trying to read or modify it. Proper synchronization mechanisms, like using `synchronized` blocks or using a thread-safe data structure like `ConcurrentHashMap`, should be employed to ensure data integrity and avoid race conditions in multithreaded environments.

### What if i create an interator, then the other thread modifies it. The other thread is done doing its job and now i iterate it.

Ah, great follow-up ‚Äî let‚Äôs break this down clearly:

---

### üß† Scenario:

1. **Thread A** creates an iterator over a `HashMap` but does not use it yet.
2. **Thread B** modifies the `HashMap` (adds/removes entries).
3. **Thread B finishes.**
4. **Thread A now starts iterating over the iterator it previously created.**

---

### ‚ùó What will happen?

‚úÖ **Yes, a `ConcurrentModificationException` can still be thrown** when Thread A begins iteration **after** the modification.

Why?

- **Iterators in Java‚Äôs `HashMap` are fail-fast.**
- They track the internal **mod count** (modification count).
- When the iterator was created (in step 1), it captured the current mod count.
- In step 2, when Thread B modified the map, the mod count was changed.
- In step 4, when Thread A _starts_ iterating, the iterator checks if the current mod count is still the same.
  - If not ‚Üí `ConcurrentModificationException` is thrown.

---

### üîç So even if you haven‚Äôt **started iterating yet**, as long as the map was modified after iterator creation, the iteration will fail when it begins.

---

### ‚úÖ Safe Alternatives:

- Use a `ConcurrentHashMap` ‚Äî iterators there are **weakly consistent** (they won‚Äôt throw exceptions but may not reflect the latest changes).
- Or, use **synchronization** around both the iterator creation and iteration, as well as modification, like:

```java
synchronized (map) {
    Iterator<Map.Entry<Key, Value>> iterator = map.entrySet().iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        // safe iteration
    }
}
```

---

### TL;DR:

> If a `HashMap` is modified **after an iterator is created**, even if you haven‚Äôt started iterating yet, a `ConcurrentModificationException` will be thrown **when you start iterating** ‚Äî unless you're using synchronization or a thread-safe alternative.
