Multi-threading in Java allows you to create and manage multiple threads of execution within a single Java program. Threads are lightweight sub-processes that share the same memory space and can execute concurrently, making it possible to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Java provides built-in support for multi-threading through the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `java.util.concurrent` package. Here are the fundamental concepts and steps for working with multi-threading in Java:

**1. Creating Threads:**

- You can create threads by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.
- Extending the `Thread` class:

  ```java
  class MyThread extends Thread {
      public void run() {
          // Code to be executed in this thread
      }
  }
  ```

- Implementing the `Runnable` interface:

  ```java
  class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
      public void run() {
          // Code to be executed in this thread
      }
  }
  ```

**2. Starting Threads:**

- To start a thread, create an instance of your thread class and call its `start()` method:

  ```java
  MyThread thread = new MyThread();
  thread.start();
  ```

  OR

  ```java
  MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
  Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
  thread.start();
  ```

**3. Thread Execution:**

- The `run()` method of your thread class or `Runnable` implementation contains the code that runs in the thread.
- When you call `start()`, Java takes care of creating a new thread, invoking the `run()` method, and running it concurrently with other threads.

**4. Thread Synchronization:**

- When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, synchronization is necessary to prevent data inconsistencies and race conditions.
- You can use synchronized blocks, locks, or other synchronization mechanisms to protect critical sections of code.

**5. Joining Threads:**

- You can use the `join()` method to wait for a thread to complete before proceeding with the rest of the program:

  ```java
  MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
  MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();
  thread1.start();
  thread2.start();
  thread1.join();
  thread2.join();
  // Continue after thread1 and thread2 finish
  ```

### What is executorservice

> **`ExecutorService`** is an interface in Java used to **manage and control threads** ‚Äî especially useful for running **tasks asynchronously** using a **thread pool**.

---

### üîß Why use it?

Instead of manually creating threads:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> doSomething());
t.start();
```

You can use:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
executor.submit(() -> doSomething());
```

---

### üß† Key Features:

- Manages **thread pooling** efficiently.
- Methods like:

  - `submit()` ‚Äì submit a task for execution
  - `shutdown()` ‚Äì gracefully stop accepting tasks
  - `invokeAll()` ‚Äì run multiple tasks and wait for results

- Supports both **Runnable** and **Callable** (which returns a value)

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 1"));
        executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 2"));

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

---

### üß† Summary:

> **ExecutorService = thread manager**
> It helps run tasks in background threads efficiently, without manually handling thread creation and cleanup.

### what service is used in java that executes multiple tasks on a different thread but sequentially

In Java, if you want to execute multiple tasks on different threads but sequentially, you can use the `ExecutorService` in combination with a single-threaded executor, specifically a `SingleThreadExecutor`.

Here's how you can achieve sequential execution of tasks using a `SingleThreadExecutor`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class SequentialTaskExecution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a SingleThreadExecutor
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        // Submit tasks for execution
        executor.execute(() -> {
            // Task 1
            System.out.println("Task 1 executed");
        });

        executor.execute(() -> {
            // Task 2
            System.out.println("Task 2 executed");
        });

        executor.execute(() -> {
            // Task 3
            System.out.println("Task 3 executed");
        });

        // Shutdown the executor when done
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `SingleThreadExecutor`, which uses a single worker thread for executing tasks sequentially. When you submit tasks for execution using `execute()`, they are placed in a queue and executed one after the other in the order they were submitted.

Using a `SingleThreadExecutor` ensures that tasks are processed in a single thread, which guarantees sequential execution, even though they are processed concurrently by that single thread.

This approach is useful when you want to maintain task execution order but still take advantage of concurrency when performing asynchronous operations or handling multiple tasks in a single-threaded manner.

### Difference between execute() and submit()

Great question! In Java‚Äôs `ExecutorService`, both `execute()` and `submit()` are used to run tasks, but there are **important differences** between the two:

---

### ‚úÖ `execute(Runnable task)`

- **Returns:** `void`
- **Introduced in:** `Executor` interface
- **Use case:** When you just want to run a task and don‚Äôt care about the result or handling exceptions directly.

#### Example:

```java
executor.execute(() -> {
    System.out.println("Executing a task");
});
```

- If the task throws an exception, it will be handled by the executor‚Äôs internal error handler (typically logged, but not accessible to your code).

---

### ‚úÖ `submit(Callable/Void) task`

- **Returns:** `Future<?>`
- **Introduced in:** `ExecutorService` interface
- **Use case:** When you want:
  - To get a result from a task
  - To check if a task is done
  - To cancel a task
  - To catch exceptions thrown during execution

#### Example:

```java
Future<String> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    return "Task result";
});

try {
    String result = future.get(); // blocks until result is available
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

---

### üîç Summary Table:

| Feature               | `execute()`    | `submit()`                 |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Return Type           | `void`         | `Future<?>`                |
| Handles `Callable`    | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ                         |
| Handles `Runnable`    | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                         |
| Can retrieve result   | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ (via `Future.get()`)    |
| Can detect exceptions | ‚ùå (logs only) | ‚úÖ (via `Future.get()`)    |
| Can cancel task       | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ (`future.cancel(true)`) |

---

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a practical example comparing both in action.

### what would happen if i start listening to their futures in this code segment only ?

If you start listening to their **Futures** immediately after `submit()` in your code, it can **change how the tasks behave**, especially in terms of execution order and concurrency.

Let me show you what that looks like and what changes:

---

### üîÅ Your Original Code (asynchronous execution):

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 1 executed"));
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 2 executed"));
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 3 executed"));
executor.shutdown();
```

- All tasks are submitted almost simultaneously.
- They run concurrently on 3 threads.
- You don't **wait** for any task to complete in this code.

---

### ‚úÖ Now, Using Futures (sequential waits):

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

Future<?> f1 = executor.submit(() -> {
    try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    System.out.println("Task 1 executed");
});
Future<?> f2 = executor.submit(() -> {
    try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    System.out.println("Task 2 executed");
});
Future<?> f3 = executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task 3 executed");
});

// Block until each future is done
try {
    f1.get(); // Waits for Task 1 to complete
    f2.get(); // Waits for Task 2
    f3.get(); // Waits for Task 3
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

executor.shutdown();
```

---

### üß† So what changes?

1. **Calling `.get()` blocks** the main thread until that task is done.
2. The tasks still run concurrently (in the thread pool), **but your main thread waits in the order you call `.get()`**.
3. If Task 1 is slow, everything waits behind it ‚Äî even if Task 3 finishes fast.

---

### üß™ Output:

```
Task 3 executed
Task 2 executed
Task 1 executed
```

Why is Task 3 executing before Task 1 ‚Äî even though f1.get() is called first?
Because calling f1.get() does not control the order in which tasks start executing, it only waits for that task to finish.
You‚Äôre using:

java
Copy
Edit
ExecutorService executor3 = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
üîπ This creates a thread pool with 3 threads.

Then, you submit 3 tasks. All are submitted almost at the same time, and since there are 3 threads, all tasks start running concurrently.

f1.get() simply blocks the main thread until Task 1 finishes ‚Äî but it does not force Task 1 to start first.

So, if Task 3 finishes first, its output will appear first

### when is this beneficial, i mean waiting for task1 to get completed ?

Great question!

Waiting for `task1.get()` (i.e., blocking until **a specific task completes**) is useful when your **program logic depends on the result or completion of that task before proceeding**.

---

## ‚úÖ When waiting for `task1.get()` is beneficial:

---

### 1. **When You Need the Result of That Task**

If `task1` returns some value that is required for the next steps:

```java
Future<Integer> f1 = executor.submit(() -> calculateTotal());
int total = f1.get(); // Block until result is available
process(total);       // Now you can use it
```

---

### 2. **When Tasks Must Be Done in a Certain Logical Order**

Even if they're running in parallel, sometimes you **must wait** for certain tasks before starting others.

```java
Future<?> f1 = executor.submit(() -> prepareData());
f1.get(); // Ensure data is ready

Future<?> f2 = executor.submit(() -> processData()); // Safe to run now
```

---

### 3. **To Prevent Resource Conflicts**

If task2 depends on a shared resource that task1 modifies or initializes, you may want to wait for task1.

```java
// Task 1 initializes a file
Future<?> f1 = executor.submit(() -> setupFile());
f1.get(); // Wait until file is ready

// Task 2 writes into the file
executor.submit(() -> writeToFile());
```

---

### 4. **For Controlled Progress Tracking or Logging**

You might want to log progress only after key stages are completed.

```java
Future<?> f1 = executor.submit(() -> heavyComputation());
f1.get(); // After heavy task
System.out.println("Heavy computation done.");
```

---

### 5. **To Throttle Parallel Workflows**

If you don‚Äôt want too many tasks running at once, `get()` can be used to pace them:

```java
// Submit and wait before queuing the next batch
for (...) {
    Future<?> f = executor.submit(task);
    f.get(); // wait before submitting next
}
```

---

## ‚ùå When Not Beneficial:

- If you're calling `get()` **immediately after submit**, you **lose parallelism** ‚Äî it behaves almost like sequential code.
- Better in that case: collect all futures ‚Üí wait for all of them later (e.g., with `invokeAll()` or looping over `futures`).

---

## üß† Summary:

| Use `f1.get()` when:                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚úÖ You need the task's result                          |
| ‚úÖ Later tasks depend on it                            |
| ‚úÖ You want controlled execution or pacing             |
| ‚úÖ You‚Äôre managing resource dependency or shared state |

---

Let me know if you'd like an example using `invokeAll()` or async patterns using `CompletableFuture`!

### InvokeAll AND CompletableFuture

Sure! Here's a clean, practical example of both **`invokeAll`** and **`CompletableFuture`** to run multiple tasks concurrently and manage results.

---

## ‚úÖ Example 1: `invokeAll()` ‚Äì Wait for a Batch of Tasks

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class InvokeAllExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        List<Callable<String>> tasks = List.of(
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                return "Task 1 Done";
            },
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(500);
                return "Task 2 Done";
            },
            () -> "Task 3 Done"
        );

        // Submit all tasks and wait for all to complete
        List<Future<String>> results = executor.invokeAll(tasks);

        for (Future<String> future : results) {
            System.out.println(future.get()); // Blocking until each task is done
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### üß† When to Use `invokeAll`:

- When you want to run **a batch of tasks together**
- When you want to **wait for all of them to complete** before continuing

---

## ‚úÖ Example 2: `CompletableFuture` ‚Äì Modern, Non-blocking Async Execution

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> task1 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            System.out.println("‚úÖ Task 1 Done");
        });

        CompletableFuture<Void> task2 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            System.out.println("‚úÖ Task 2 Done");
        });

        CompletableFuture<Void> task3 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("‚úÖ Task 3 Done");
        });

        // Wait for all tasks to complete (non-blocking style)
        CompletableFuture.allOf(task1, task2, task3)
                         .thenRun(() -> System.out.println("üéâ All tasks finished"))
                         .join(); // Block only at the end
    }
}
```

### üß† When to Use `CompletableFuture`:

- When you want **asynchronous programming without managing threads**
- To create **non-blocking, event-driven logic**
- To **chain tasks** with `.thenApply()`, `.thenCombine()`, etc.

---

## üîÑ Summary:

| Feature      | `invokeAll()`                | `CompletableFuture`                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Blocking?    | ‚úÖ Yes (waits for all tasks) | ‚ùå Non-blocking (unless you call `.join()`) |
| Best for     | Batch task execution         | Reactive, chainable async logic             |
| Returns      | `List<Future<T>>`            | `CompletableFuture<T>`                      |
| Java Version | Since Java 5                 | Since Java 8                                |

---

Let me know if you'd like an example where tasks depend on each other using `thenApply()` or `thenCompose()`!

### Synchronized in java

```java

public class SynchronizedExample {

    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SynchronizedExample example = new SynchronizedExample();

        // Create multiple threads to increment the count
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                example.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                example.increment();
            }
        });

        // Start the threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        try {
            // Wait for both threads to finish
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Print the final count
        System.out.println("Final Count: " + example.count);
    }
}

```

### The synchronized keyword in Java is used to create synchronized blocks of code or synchronized methods to ensure that only one thread can access that code block or method at a time. This is often used to prevent concurrent access to shared resources, such as variables or objects, which could lead to data inconsistencies or race conditions in a multi-threaded environment.

//In this example, we have a SynchronizedExample class with an increment method that is synchronized using the synchronized keyword.
// We create two threads (thread1 and thread2) that both call the increment method, which ensures that only one thread can execute the increment method at a time.
// This prevents data corruption that could occur if both threads tried to increment count simultaneously.

// When you run this program, you'll see that the final count is always 20,000, even though two threads are incrementing it concurrently.
// This demonstrates how the synchronized keyword can be used to safely coordinate access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment

### What is the use of volatile keyword in java ?

The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's **value will be modified by different threads**. It tells the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and **compiler** that the variable is **not cached locally**, and all reads and writes go directly to **main memory**.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Features of `volatile`:

1. **Visibility Guarantee**:

   - Changes to a `volatile` variable by one thread are immediately visible to other threads.

2. **No Caching**:

   - The variable is always read from and written to main memory, not CPU cache or thread-local cache.

3. **No Atomicity**:

   - It does **not make operations atomic**. For example:

     ```java
     volatile int count = 0;
     count++;  // NOT atomic
     ```

     This `count++` is still not thread-safe ‚Äî it involves read-modify-write steps.

4. **Lightweight Alternative to Synchronized**:

   - For some cases where you only need visibility (not mutual exclusion), `volatile` is more efficient than `synchronized`.

---

### üß† Example:

```java
class SharedData {
    volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void writer() {
        flag = true;  // write happens here
    }

    public void reader() {
        if (flag) {
            System.out.println("Flag is true");  // guaranteed to see latest value
        }
    }
}
```

Without `volatile`, one thread might **never see** the update to `flag` because it may read from a cached value.

---

### ‚ùå When `volatile` is Not Enough:

- When you need **atomicity**, like with `++`, or compound actions:
  Use `AtomicInteger`, `synchronized`, or locks instead.

---

### ‚úÖ When to Use:

- Status flags (like `isRunning`, `shouldStop`)
- Singleton instance references in **Double-Checked Locking** pattern

---

### üß™ Interview Tip:

`volatile` ensures **happens-before** relationship:

- A write to a `volatile` variable **happens-before** a subsequent read of that variable.
  When we want visibility only and not atomicity the we use volatile keyword

..https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/volatile-keyword-in-java/

### What is an atomic operation ?

An **atomic operation** is an operation that is **indivisible** ‚Äî meaning it **either happens completely or doesn't happen at all**, and **cannot be interrupted** by other threads.

---

### üîë Characteristics of Atomic Operations:

1. **Uninterruptible**:

   - No other thread can see the operation in a half-completed state.

2. **Thread-Safe by Nature**:

   - You don‚Äôt need synchronization for atomic operations.

---

### üìå Example (Non-Atomic):

```java
int count = 0;
count++;  // NOT atomic
```

`count++` looks simple, but it's actually **three steps**:

1. Read `count`
2. Increment it
3. Write back

If two threads do this at the same time, you can get **race conditions**.

---

### ‚úÖ Example (Atomic):

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet();  // Atomic
```

- This method is **atomic**.
- Guaranteed to be thread-safe without needing `synchronized`.

---

### üß† In Java, common atomic operations include:

- `AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet()`
- `AtomicInteger.getAndDecrement()`
- `AtomicBoolean.set(true)`
- `volatile` read/write (just the access is atomic, not compound operations)

---

### üß™ Summary:

| Operation                         | Atomic? | Thread-Safe? |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| `x = 5` (simple write)            | ‚úÖ      | üö´ (depends) |
| `x++`                             | ‚ùå      | ‚ùå           |
| `AtomicInteger.get()`             | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ           |
| `AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet()` | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ           |

Let me know if you want a breakdown of which Java primitive operations are atomic or not!

####

// Java Program to demonstrate the
// use of Volatile Keyword in Java
Sure! Here's a **much simpler version** of your program that demonstrates the use of the `volatile` keyword in Java **without any logging framework**, just using `System.out.println`.

---

### ‚úÖ Simplified Volatile Example in Java:

```java
public class VolatileSimpleDemo {

    private static volatile int counter = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Thread that observes changes
        new Thread(() -> {
            int localValue = counter;
            while (localValue < 5) {
                if (localValue != counter) {
                    System.out.println("Counter changed to: " + counter);
                    localValue = counter;
                }
            }
        }).start();

        // Thread that changes the value
        new Thread(() -> {
            int localValue = counter;
            while (counter < 5) {
                System.out.println("Incrementing counter to: " + (localValue + 1));
                counter = ++localValue;
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }).start();
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ What this demonstrates:

- `volatile` ensures that changes to `counter` made by one thread are **immediately visible** to the other thread.
- Without `volatile`, the `ChangeListener` thread might cache the value and never see updates and would never break

### what is local thread in java ?

In Java, **"local thread"** usually refers to **ThreadLocal**, a class that provides **thread-local variables**‚Äîvariables that are **local to the current thread**. Each thread accessing such a variable has **its own independent copy**, and changes made by one thread **are not visible to others**.

---

### üîπ `ThreadLocal` in Java

- A `ThreadLocal<T>` provides a separate instance of a variable **per thread**.
- Useful in **multi-threaded environments** where you want to avoid sharing state between threads.
- Commonly used in:

  - User sessions
  - Database connections
  - Request contexts in web applications

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

```java
public class ThreadLocalExample {
    private static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalValue = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            threadLocalValue.set(threadLocalValue.get() + 1);
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + threadLocalValue.get());
        };

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-A");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-B");

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

**Output (example):**

```
Thread-A: 1
Thread-B: 1
```

Even though `threadLocalValue` is a static variable, each thread sees its **own copy**.

---

### üîí Why use `ThreadLocal`?

- Avoid **synchronization** overhead.
- Keep data **isolated** per thread.
- Useful in frameworks like Spring, Hibernate for managing per-thread contexts.

---

### if a custom object is used in thread local an each thread modifies the object value using set operations of that object. Will this be prevented ?

Great question ‚Äî and this touches a very important **misconception** about `ThreadLocal`.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è **`ThreadLocal` does _not_ make the object itself thread-safe. It only ensures each thread gets its _own reference_ to that object.**

---

### üîç What Happens in Your Case

If you use a **mutable custom object** inside a `ThreadLocal`, and each thread _modifies the object's internal state_, you're safe **only if**:

- **Each thread** gets **its own separate instance** of the object via `ThreadLocal.set()` or `ThreadLocal.withInitial(...)`.

If **multiple threads** accidentally share the **same instance** inside their respective `ThreadLocal`, then **modifications are not thread-safe** and can cause **race conditions**.

---

### ‚úÖ Safe Use Example:

```java
public class MyContext {
    private String value;
    public void setValue(String value) { this.value = value; }
    public String getValue() { return value; }
}

private static ThreadLocal<MyContext> context = ThreadLocal.withInitial(MyContext::new);

// Each thread modifies its own object:
context.get().setValue("thread-specific-value");
```

Each thread will get its **own `MyContext` object**, so modifying `value` is safe ‚Äî **no interference** between threads.

---

### ‚ùå Unsafe (Incorrect) Use:

```java
MyContext shared = new MyContext();
private static ThreadLocal<MyContext> context = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> shared);
```

Now every thread gets the **same instance**, so even though `ThreadLocal` is used, **the object is shared**, and **not thread-safe** anymore.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Case                                                           | Thread-safe? |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Each thread gets its **own object** instance via `ThreadLocal` | ‚úÖ Yes       |
| Multiple threads share the **same object**                     | ‚ùå No        |

So:

> **ThreadLocal protects the reference, not the internal thread-safety of the object.**

If the object is **mutable and shared**, you still need to synchronize or use thread-safe data structures.

Let me know if you want a working code demo of both cases.

### Give an Example of threadLocal

Here's a **real-world example** of using `ThreadLocal` in Java ‚Äî one that's often seen in **web applications**:

---

## ‚úÖ Use Case: **User Context in Web Applications**

In a typical web application, **each request** is handled by a **separate thread**. You might want to store user-specific data (like authentication info or request ID) **only for the lifetime of that request/thread**, and ensure it‚Äôs isolated from other threads.

### ‚ú® This is where `ThreadLocal` shines.

---

## üß© Example: `ThreadLocal` for Storing Current Logged-in User

### üëá UserContext.java

```java
public class UserContext {
    private static final ThreadLocal<String> currentUser = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void setUser(String user) {
        currentUser.set(user);
    }

    public static String getUser() {
        return currentUser.get();
    }

    public static void clear() {
        currentUser.remove(); // always good to clean up
    }
}
```

---

### üëá Usage in a Servlet/Filter

```java
public class AuthenticationFilter {
    public void doFilter(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
        try {
            String user = request.getHeader("X-User"); // get user from request header
            UserContext.setUser(user); // store in thread-local

            chain.doFilter(request, response); // continue processing
        } finally {
            UserContext.clear(); // prevent memory leaks in thread pools
        }
    }
}
```

---

### üëá Usage in Business Logic

```java
public class OrderService {
    public void createOrder() {
        String user = UserContext.getUser();
        System.out.println("Creating order for user: " + user);
    }
}
```

---

## üîí Why `ThreadLocal`?

- No need to **pass `user` as a parameter** to every method.
- Thread-safe because each thread/request gets **its own isolated copy**.
- Avoids **global variables** and **race conditions**.
- Helps maintain clean and modular design.

---

### üßº Important:

Always **call `.remove()`** at the end of the thread‚Äôs lifecycle (especially in **thread pools**) to prevent **memory leaks**.

---

Would you like a Spring Boot version of this example or an implementation with actual HTTP simulation?

### Since this is executed on thread will not every thread make its own copy without using ThreadLocal<> in the usercontext class.

Great question ‚Äî and it's a common confusion!

> **"If every request is handled by a separate thread, won‚Äôt each thread already have its own data? Why do I need `ThreadLocal`?"**

### ‚úÖ Short Answer:

**No**, unless you explicitly use `ThreadLocal`, shared objects (like `UserContext.currentUser`) are **shared across all threads**, not thread-safe, and can lead to **data leaks or collisions**.

---

### üß† Let‚Äôs break it down:

#### üîÅ Without `ThreadLocal`:

If you simply use a **regular static variable** or instance variable in a singleton service class:

```java
public class UserContext {
    public static String currentUser; // ‚ö†Ô∏è shared by all threads!
}
```

Now when Thread-1 sets `currentUser = "Alice"` and Thread-2 sets `currentUser = "Bob"`, they are **overwriting the same variable** ‚Äî race condition! üò±

#### ‚úÖ With `ThreadLocal`:

When you use:

```java
private static final ThreadLocal<String> currentUser = new ThreadLocal<>();
```

Each thread calling `currentUser.set("Alice")` **stores Alice only for that thread**. Other threads won‚Äôt see or modify it ‚Äî it's **isolated** and **safe**.

---

### üí° Why this matters in web apps:

Web servers (like Tomcat) **reuse threads** from a thread pool. If you don't use `ThreadLocal`, thread-specific data (like user ID, request ID, etc.) can **leak** from one request to another. That‚Äôs a **huge security bug**.

---

### üîß Analogy:

Imagine `ThreadLocal` as a **locker room**, where every thread has its **own private locker**. They can put whatever they want in it ‚Äî but **no one else can see inside**.

---

### üîÑ So, can't I pass user as a parameter?

Yes, you can. But:

- It clutters method signatures.
- It‚Äôs harder to manage across multiple layers (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí DAO).
- It doesn't scale well for cross-cutting concerns (like logging, tracing, auth).

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

| Without `ThreadLocal`          | With `ThreadLocal`                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Shared state across threads    | Thread-isolated state                  |
| Risk of data races & leaks     | Safe and isolated per-thread data      |
| Requires explicit data passing | No need to pass data down method chain |
