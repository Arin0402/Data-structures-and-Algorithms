### Can we use long long in java ?

In Java, you can use the primitive data type `long` to represent 64-bit signed integers, which have a range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. This should cover most requirements for dealing with large integer values.

However, if you need even larger integer values that exceed the range of a standard `long`, you can use the `BigInteger` class from the `java.math` package. `BigInteger` is an arbitrary-precision integer class, meaning it can represent integers of virtually any size, limited only by the available memory.

Here's how you can use `BigInteger` in Java:

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class LargeIntegerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create BigInteger objects
        BigInteger bigInt1 = new BigInteger("123456789012345678901234567890");
        BigInteger bigInt2 = new BigInteger("987654321098765432109876543210");

        // Perform arithmetic operations
        BigInteger sum = bigInt1.add(bigInt2);
        BigInteger product = bigInt1.multiply(bigInt2);

        // Print the results
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we've used `BigInteger` to represent very large integers and performed addition and multiplication operations on them.

Keep in mind that `BigInteger` operations may be slower than those on primitive types like `long`, as they involve arbitrary-precision arithmetic. However, `BigInteger` is a powerful tool for handling very large integer values when needed.

### so long long is not supported ?

In Java, there is no `long long` data type as you might find in some other programming languages like C or C++. Java uses the `long` data type to represent 64-bit signed integers, which have a wide range and are suitable for most integer-based calculations.

### How does BigInteger works ?

> `BigInteger` is a **class in `java.math` package** that allows you to work with **very large integers** — beyond the limit of `int` (32-bit) or `long` (64-bit).

### 🔍 Internally:

- `BigInteger` uses a **mutable array of integers (int\[])** to store digits.
- It performs **manual arithmetic** (like addition, multiplication) on this array, similar to how you do it on paper.
- All operations return a **new BigInteger object** (it's immutable).

---

### ✅ Example:

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BigInteger a = new BigInteger("999999999999999999999999");
        BigInteger b = new BigInteger("111111111111111111111111");

        BigInteger sum = a.add(b);
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

🟰 Output:

```
1111111111111111111111110
```

---

### 🔐 Key Features:

- No overflow (unlike `int` or `long`)
- Supports arithmetic: `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, `mod()`
- Immutable (just like `String`)

---

### 🧠 Summary:

> `BigInteger` handles **arbitrarily large numbers** using arrays and custom math logic, making it perfect for high-precision calculations like cryptography or factorials.

### Why value of int and long become 0 if the value stored is greater then the supported limit ?

In Java, if the value stored in an `int` or `long` variable exceeds the supported limit for that data type, it doesn't automatically become 0. Instead, it experiences what is known as "overflow" or "wraparound." The behavior of overflow depends on the specific data type:

1. **`int` (32-bit)**:

   - The range of an `int` in Java is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
   - If you try to store a value that is greater than the maximum (`2,147,483,647`) or smaller than the minimum (`-2,147,483,648`), overflow occurs.
   - In the case of overflow, the value wraps around. For example, if you add 1 to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it wraps around to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. Similarly, if you subtract 1 from `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, it wraps around to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

   ```java
   int maxInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // 2,147,483,647
   maxInt = maxInt + 1; // Overflow: maxInt becomes Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2,147,483,648)
   ```

2. **`long` (64-bit)**:

   - The range of a `long` in Java is from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
   - If you try to store a value that is greater than the maximum (`9,223,372,036,854,775,807`) or smaller than the minimum (`-9,223,372,036,854,775,808`), overflow occurs.
   - Similar to `int`, in the case of overflow, the value wraps around. However, the range for `long` is much larger, so overflow is less likely to occur in practice.

   ```java
   long maxLong = Long.MAX_VALUE; // 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
   maxLong = maxLong + 1; // Overflow: maxLong becomes Long.MIN_VALUE (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808)
   ```

It's essential to be aware of overflow when working with integer data types, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results in your programs. To handle situations where overflow might occur, you can use conditional checks or consider using the `BigInteger` class for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, which doesn't suffer from overflow.

### Factorial program using big integer

In Java, the `int` data type can represent integers within the range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. The factorial of 89 is a very large number and exceeds the range of representable `int` values. As a result, integer overflow occurs, and the result becomes 0 because it "wraps around" within the range of `int`.

To calculate the factorial of larger numbers like 89, you should use a data type that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as the `BigInteger` class from the `java.math` package. Here's how you can modify your code to calculate the factorial of 89 using `BigInteger`:

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

BigInteger getFactorial(int num) {
    if (num <= 2) {
        return BigInteger.valueOf(num);
    }
    return BigInteger.valueOf(num).multiply(getFactorial(num - 1));
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    YourClassName obj = new YourClassName();
    int number = 89;
    BigInteger factorial = obj.getFactorial(number);
    System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is:\n" + factorial);
}
```

With this modification, your code will correctly calculate the factorial of 89 without encountering integer overflow, and the result will be a `BigInteger` representing the large factorial value.

### Limited by available Memory. Is it disk or RAM ?

Great question!

When we say `BigInteger` is limited by **available memory**, we are referring to **RAM (Random Access Memory)**, **not disk**.

Here's why:

### 💡 Why it's RAM:

- **Java programs run in memory (RAM)**: When you create a `BigInteger`, the JVM stores its data in RAM, just like any other object.
- **Operations are done in memory**: All arithmetic operations on `BigInteger` (addition, multiplication, etc.) happen in RAM.
- **Garbage collection** also applies to these objects, as they reside on the heap (which is in RAM).

### 📦 What about disk?

- Disk space is not used unless you're explicitly writing `BigInteger` values to a file.
- Disk is much slower than RAM and not involved in normal in-memory computation.

So yes, the size of a `BigInteger` is theoretically "unlimited," but practically limited by how much **heap memory (RAM)** your JVM has access to.

Let me know if you want to see how much memory a given `BigInteger` might use!
