1.  10 >> 3 = 10 / 2^3
2. 10 << 3 = 10 * 2^3
3. swap two numbers a, b using bit man.

    a = a^b  ( ^ is xor)
    b = a^b
    a = a^b

4. find the value of xor of all the numbers between 1 to n.

    - O(1) solution
    - write xor for each n starting from 1
    - we will observe a pattern

    - if(n%4 == 0) print n
    - else if(n%4 == 1) print(1)
    - else if(n%4 == 2) print(n + 1)
    - else if(n%4 == 3) print(0)

5. find the value of xor of all the numbers in range l and r.
    
    - O(1) solution
    - step 1 -> find xor of all the elements between 1 to r.
    - step 2 -> find xor of all the elements between 1 to l-1.
    - step 3 -> xor both values as it will cancel the duplicates.

6. clear ith bit of a number.
    
    - n & ~(1 << i)

7. Remove the first set bit from the right.

    - ex :- 1101 -> 1100

    - n & (n-1)

8. check if a number is a power of two.
    
    - if n & (n-1) == 0. then yes, else no

9. Get the rightmost setbit of a number
    - n & ~(n - 1)

10. How positive and negative integers are stored in the memory and all the points related to that (1 minute read)

In a two's complement representation of signed integers using 32 bits, the range of values that can be represented is -2^31 to (2^31)-1. The reason for this is that the most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign bit, so the range of possible values is split evenly between negative and non-negative values.

The MSB has a value of -2^31, and the remaining 31 bits represent the magnitude of the value. For non-negative values, the sign bit is 0, and the remaining 31 bits are interpreted as a non-negative integer. For negative values, the sign bit is 1, and the remaining 31 bits are interpreted as the magnitude of the value in two's complement form.

So the maximum value that can be represented by a signed 32-bit integer is (2^31)-1, which is the largest possible non-negative integer that can be represented using 31 bits. The minimum value that can be represented is -2^31, which is the most negative value that can be represented using 31 bits and the sign bit.

It's important to note that the use of a sign bit doesn't reduce the maximum value that can be represented. The sign bit simply determines whether a value is negative or non-negative, and the magnitude of the value is still represented using the remaining bits.

Let's consider a signed integer representation using 4 bits. The most significant bit (MSB) represents the sign of the value, with 0 indicating a non-negative value and 1 indicating a negative value. The remaining three bits represent the magnitude of the value in binary form.

Using this representation, the range of values that can be represented is:

For non-negative values: 0 to (2^3)-1 = 7
For negative values: -(2^3) to -1
The following table shows the possible values that can be represented using this signed integer representation:

Binary	Decimal
0000	0
0001	1
0010	2
0011	3
0100	4
0101	5
0110	6
0111	7
1000	-8
1001	-7
1010	-6
1011	-5
1100	-4
1101	-3
1110	-2
1111	-1
As you can see, the range of non-negative values goes from 0 to 7, and the range of negative values goes from -8 to -1. The MSB is used as the sign bit, so for non-negative values, the MSB is always 0, and for negative values, the MSB is always 1.

Now let's consider the signed integer representation using 4 bits without a sign bit. In this case, all 4 bits represent the magnitude of the value, and the range of values that can be represented is:

0 to (2^4)-1 = 15

The following table shows the possible values that can be represented using this unsigned integer representation:

Binary	Decimal
0000	0
0001	1
0010	2
0011	3
0100	4
0101	5
0110	6
0111	7
1000	8
1001	9
1010	10
1011	11
1100	12
1101	13
1110	14
1111	15
As you can see, the range of possible values is larger than in the signed integer representation with a sign bit, but it doesn't allow for negative values.

In summary, the use of a sign bit allows for both negative and non-negative values to be represented in a smaller range of values, while an unsigned integer representation uses all bits to represent only non-negative values in a larger range.
