1. Tree traversal time O(n);
2. Tree traversal space complexity(stack) -- for skewed tree -- O(n);
                                          -- for balanced tree -- O(logn);
3. Depth first Traversal - preorder, inorder, postorder.
4. Breadth first traversal - level order traversal                                        

Types of trees
    - Full binary tree :
        Either 0 or 2 children
    - Complete binary tree :
        - All levels should be completely filled except the last levels
        - Last level should have all the nodes as left as possible.
    - Perfect Binary tree  
        - All leaf nodes are at the same level.
    - Balanced binary tree 
        - Height of binary tree is at max log(N), where n = number of nodes.
    - Degenerate Tree  
        - skewed tree.

5. Search Time in Binary Tree - O(N);
6. Search Time in Binary Search Tree - O(logn);
7. Almost every BST height is O(logn);
8. Inorder of BST is always in sorted order.
