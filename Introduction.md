-Hi, My name is Arin Goyal and I have completed my B.Tech from JECRC, Jaipur specialized in Computer science and engineering in the year 2024 with an overall CGPA of 9.26.

-I have done my schooling from Jaipur and I was the school topper among all the streams in 12th standard with 96.2 percentage.

-I chose to pursue engineering because I love problem solving and I think problem solving skill is something which is required in each sector we see today.

- After my graduation, I have done a three months internship at Futures First and 6 months Internship at Autodesk, Bangalore. where I under took the crucial task of database remodelling and end-to-end development of persistent notifications feature. This internship helped me to build a positive attitude to approach a problem because half of the problem is solved when you have a positive and a clear mindset.

-I like to explore new domains and learn about them.

- Apart from this my hobbies include travelling, music and recently I have picked up reading books as my hobby.

- I am currently working as Specialist Programmer at Infosys, Pune from September 2024.

- I’m really grateful for the opportunity to interview with Amazon, and I’m excited to be here.

Why Amazon, if you're already at Infosys?”
“I’m grateful for the opportunity at Infosys — it has given me a strong foundation and exposure to real-world software development in a structured environment.

However, I’m particularly drawn to Amazon because of its strong engineering culture, emphasis on ownership, and impact at global scale. I’m excited about the chance to work on high-scale, customer-facing systems, and I believe Amazon’s leadership principles — especially ownership, delivering results, and constantly learning — strongly align with how I want to grow as a software engineer.

For me, Amazon offers the kind of fast-paced, innovative environment where I can challenge myself more deeply and contribute meaningfully to products that impact millions.”
