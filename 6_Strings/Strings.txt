1. compare in strings

    // code 1

    if((s1.compare(s2)) < 0)
        cout << s1 << " is smaller than " << s2 << endl;

    if((s1.compare(s2)) > 0)
        cout << s1 << " is greater than " << s2 << endl;
     
    if((s1.compare(s1)) == 0)
        cout << s1 << " is equal to " << s1 << endl;
    else
        cout << "Strings didn't match ";
    
    //code 2

    // Compares 5 characters from index number 3 of s2 with s1
    if((s2.compare(3, 5, s1)) == 0)
        cout << "Here, "<< s1 << " are " << s2;
 
    else
        cout << "Strings didn't match ";

2. Key Differences Between Character Array and String
    - A character array is a collection of variables which are of character datatype. String is a class that is instantiated to declare strings.
    - Using index value you can access a character from a character array. On the other hand, if you want to access a particular character in a string, you can access it by function stringâ€™s_name.charAt(index).
    - As an array is not a datatype similarly a character also is not a datatype. On the other hand, String being a class act as a reference type hence, it can be said String is a data type.
    - You can not apply any operator on a character array whereas, you can apply operators on String.
    - Being an array character array has a fixed length and its boundaries can be easily overrun. Where String does not have any boundaries.
    - Array elements are stored in a contiguous memory location hence that can be accessed faster than string variable.
