# Prototype pattern

    - The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern used to clone an existing object instead of creating a new one from scratch. This helps improve performance when object creation is expensive.

    - ✅ Key Benefits:

        ✔ Faster object creation (no need to reinitialize everything)
        ✔ Reduces memory usage (reuses existing objects)
        ✔ Best for copying complex objects

    - code is wrong as still shallow copy is being created but the concept is right
