# Singleton pattern

    - A Singleton Class ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global access point to it.

    ✅ Key Benefits:

        ✔ Saves memory by reusing the same object
        ✔ Prevents multiple instances, avoiding conflicts
        ✔ Used in logging, database connections, caching, etc.
