# Adapter design pattern

    - The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them.

    - ðŸ”¹ Key Points of Adapter Pattern:
    âœ… Bridges the gap between incompatible interfaces
    âœ… No need to modify existing code
    âœ… Supports both class-based (inheritance) and object-based (composition) adapters

    - Cons

        - The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes itâ€™s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code.
