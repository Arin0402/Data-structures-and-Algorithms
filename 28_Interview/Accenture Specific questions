- Explain your project 

	- so I have in total 5 projects in total in my portfolio including the internship projects, personal projects and team projects

	Adimin Panel

	- Talking about the internship project, I worked on a admin panel for analytics, inventory management, and daily work monitoring 	purposes along with one other guy
	- It included a dashboard for analytics including graphs, tables etc. 
	- Inventory mamangement portion where the person can keep the track of 17000 skus and see which products are available and where 	they are available i.e the location
	- dynamic forms were created to get the details of the work din ein the whole day and other features such as authntication, 	autohrization etc
	- User management feature was also there to create, update  delete, formation of dymanic teams etc
	
	DormLife

	- So I developed a hostel management app with features like a student can check the mess menu of all the seven days of a week, 
	and a feedback forms where student can share their feed back about the food , complaints section where sturdents can lodge theor compalints and keep the track of the status, event details of what is happening in the college  , authentication and autohrization.
	
	why this project ?
	
	- So I heard from my friends that there is no management in the hostel, no one is there to listen to your complaints and if there 	is any information or update then it os not conveyed properly, so then this idea came to my mind of creating this app. 
	- I asked for the requirements from my friends and then I started working on it.
	- The plan is to deploy this project
	
	Why not deployed yet ?

	- beacuse of our end sem exam and after that our training started follwing with the placement season, soI didn't got much time but
	now I gonna work on it


	Sudoku solver app 	

	Feedback process automation
	
	- team of 3 members
	- our task was to automate the work of sending mails with attached feedback forms to the clients asking for their review. An excel sheet was given which had the list of employees along with their email ids.
	- and then to get those feedbacks and put them into a new excel sheet, so we created two bots form them
	
	Hackathon project
	
	- team of 6 persons
	- 3 persons -> frontend
	- 2 persons -> backend
	- 1 person -> data collection

	- so we created a website called kisan helping hand. The main purpose of this website was to provide information to the farmers in 	their local language
	- buy/sell portal, crops information, schemes information, fertilizer calcualtor etc
