- Some functions and case statements too. For example NVL, Decode, Rank vs Dense Rank, Timestamp functions

    The MySQL IFNULL() function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:
    The NVL does the same work in oracle

    The MySQL DECODE() function is used for decoding an encoded string and return the original string. The MySQL DECODE() function returns empty strings if the encoded string is an empty string.

    The DECODE() function accepts two parameters which are the encoded string to be decoded and the password string to decode the encoded string.

    Syntax:

    DECODE(encoded_string, password_string);

    The TIMESTAMP() function returns a datetime value based on a date or datetime value.

    SELECT TIMESTAMP("2017-07-23",  "13:10:11");
    SELECT TIMESTAMP("2017-07-23");

- what is a foreign key

    A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
    The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

- Difference between inner and outer joins?

    Inner joins and outer joins are two types of SQL JOIN operations used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. They differ in how they handle matching and non-matching rows from the tables being joined.

    Inner Join:  An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables' specified columns. If there is no match for a row in one of the tables, that row is excluded from the result set.

    Outer joins, on the other hand, come in three variations: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

    Left Join 
    
    Returns all rows from the left table (table1), and the matched rows from the right table (table2). If there is no match, NULL values are included for columns from the right table.
    It includes all rows from the left table and only matching rows from the right table.

    Right Join (RIGHT OUTER JOIN):

    Returns all rows from the right table (table2), and the matched rows from the left table (table1). If there is no match, NULL values are included for columns from the left table.
    It includes all rows from the right table and only matching rows from the left table.

    Full Join (FULL OUTER JOIN):

    Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left table (table1) or the right table (table2). If there is no match in one of the tables, NULL values are included for columns from the table without a match.
    It includes all rows from both tables, and NULLs are used where there are no matches
    
- In what language was React.JS written?
    JavaScript

- How is React.JS different from Angular.js?

    React is a JavaScript library, whereas Angular is a front-end framework. React uses one-way data binding and virtual DOM, whereas Angular supports both one way and two way  data binding and real DOM. Moreover, React is faster than Angular as it has a smaller bundle size

    Data binding is a way to synchronise the data between the model and view components automatically.

    One-way binding 

        - In one-way binding, the flow is one-directional.
        - This means that the flow of code is from ts file to  Html file.

    Two-way binding 

        - In a two-way binding, the flow is two-directional.
        - This means that the flow of code is from ts file to Html file as well as from Html file to ts file.

- Difference between primary and index keys?

    The primary key enforces uniqueness and is used for record identification, while index keys are used to improve query performance by creating data structures for faster data retrieval. Primary keys are automatically indexed in many database systems, but index keys are created manually as needed for specific columns and queries.

    Unlike primary keys, index keys do not have to contain unique values. Multiple rows in the table can have the same value in an indexed column.

- How are React.js and Node.js related to the MERN stack?

    Node.js is used as the runtime environment for the server-side code of the MERN application. Express.js, a framework built on top of Node.js, is often used to handle HTTP requests and responses,

- How does a login page work? (How the frontend, backend, and database converse while signing in!)

    In summary, a login page works by collecting user credentials on the frontend, sending them to the backend for authentication and database interaction, and establishing a session or issuing a token upon successful login. Subsequent interactions between the frontend and backend use this authentication information to ensure secure access to protected resources. The logout process terminates the user's session or token.

- What is a ‘static’ keyword in C language?

    Static Variables: inside a function
    Static Global Variables: restricts the visibility of the variable to the file in which it is defined
    Static Functions: the static keyword limits the scope of that function to the current source file

- What is SRS?
    SRS stands for "Software Requirements Specification." It is a comprehensive document that serves as a foundation for software development projects. The primary purpose of an SRS document is to clearly define and describe the requirements and expectations for a software system or application.

- What is a relationship in SQL?

    In SQL, a relationship refers to the logical association between tables in a relational database. These relationships are defined based on how data in one table is related to data in another table. Relationships are a fundamental aspect of relational database management systems (RDBMS) and help maintain data integrity, enforce referential integrity, and enable efficient data retrieval.

    ex One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:

- What is Index in SQL

    In SQL, an index is a database structure that provides a way to efficiently retrieve and access rows from a database table based on the values in one or more columns. Think of an index like the index of a book that allows you to quickly find specific information within the book. In a database, indexes serve a similar purpose by speeding up data retrieval operations, especially for large tables.

- What is View in SQL

    In SQL, a view is a virtual table that is derived from one or more tables (or other views) through a predefined query. A view does not contain any actual data itself but instead is a saved SQL query that can be referenced as if it were a table. Views provide several benefits in database management and application development

    - if we want to create a view from two tables then we have to apply join first on the tables

# How do you set your goals?

    - I approach goal-setting with a structured and disciplined process, which I believe is essential for both personal and professional growth.
    - I begin by clearly defining the specific outcome I want to achieve. 
    - requirements, time required etc
    - I ensure that my goals are measurable, meaning I can quantify progress and success. 
    - Setting achievable goals is crucial. I assess the resources, time, and skills required to accomplish the goal and ensure they are realistic. This prevents setting goals that are too ambitious or unattainable, which can lead to frustration.
    - break down into smaller goals
    - priortise

# The right thing may not be the most desirable to a person, describe a situation where you did what was right even though it wasn’t desirable?

    In my academic experience, there was a group project where we faced a situation where some team members suggested taking shortcuts to meet a tight deadline. These shortcuts involved compromising the quality of our work and potentially violating academic integrity policies.

    Even though it wasn't the most desirable option, I made the decision to uphold academic integrity. I discussed my concerns with my teammates, explained the potential consequences of the shortcuts, and proposed an alternative plan that ensured the quality and integrity of our work. This decision required additional effort and meant extending the deadline, but it was the right thing to do. Ultimately, our project was well-received, and we learned the importance of ethical decision-making and the value of quality work.

# Describe a time when you came as a role model to people ?

    While I may not have extensive professional experience as a fresher, I can draw from my academic experience. In a group project during my final year of college, I was elected as the team leader. I recognized the importance of setting a positive example for my teammates.

    I led by example in terms of dedication, work ethic, and collaboration. I ensured open communication, supported team members who needed assistance, and maintained a positive attitude, even during challenging times. As a result, I observed positive changes in the team's dynamics, and team members began to adopt similar behaviors. Our project was successful, and this experience taught me the impact of being a positive role model and leader.


# Tell me an instance where you went overboard and went beyond expectations, or went out to help someone.

    In one of my previous academic projects, a fellow classmate was facing personal challenges that made it difficult for them to keep up with their coursework. They were particularly struggling with a major assignment that was due soon, and it was clear they needed help.

    Without hesitation, I offered to assist my classmate with the assignment. We spent extra hours in the library, discussing the project's requirements and working through the material together. I shared my notes, offered explanations, and provided guidance on structuring the assignment.

    As we worked together, I realized that my classmate needed not only academic support but also emotional support and encouragement. I made an effort to be patient, understanding, and supportive throughout the process.

    We completed the assignment, and my classmate was not only able to submit it on time but also gained a better understanding of the subject matter. This experience taught me the importance of empathy and going beyond academic help to support someone in need.

    While this was a simple act of kindness, it reminded me of the impact we can have on others when we offer our assistance without expecting anything in return. It also reinforced my belief in the value of helping others whenever possible, both in academic settings and in the professional world."

# There is a Project to be done in 4 weeks and 3 weeks have passed, the client comes up to you today and asks that he wants to present to his/her manager tomorrow regarding the progress. What would you do in this situation?

    In this situation, I would start by assessing the current status of the project. This involves reviewing what has been accomplished in the first three weeks, identifying any outstanding tasks or issues, and determining the overall project health.

    Next, I would have a conversation with the client to understand their specific expectations for the progress presentation. I would ask about the key points they want to cover and any specific concerns they may have. This would help me align our presentation with their needs.

    I would then convene a meeting with the project team to discuss the client's request and the current status of the project. We would collectively assess whether it's feasible to provide a meaningful progress update in such a short time frame.

    Based on this assessment, we would prioritize the most critical aspects of the project that can be confidently presented. This might include highlighting completed work, milestones achieved, challenges faced, and proposed solutions. We would create a clear agenda for the presentation.

    Once we've prepared a presentation, I would promptly communicate with the client to confirm our understanding of their expectations and to provide a realistic overview of what can be presented tomorrow. It's important to manage the client's expectations and be transparent about any limitations due to the shortened timeline.

    During the presentation, we would focus on showcasing the project's achievements, demonstrating our understanding of the challenges, and presenting our plan for the remaining work. We would aim for a concise and informative update.

    After the presentation, I would engage in a discussion with the client about how we can better align communication and reporting in the future to avoid any last-minute requests. This would help set expectations for regular progress updates and ensure smoother project management.

    In summary, my approach would involve a systematic assessment of the situation, clear communication with the client, and a commitment to delivering a meaningful progress update despite the time constraints.
