# Laravel 

    - a framework is a set of rules, ideas or beliefs which you use in order to deal with the problems

    - a software framework is platform for developing software applications

    - we don't need to write everything form the scratch

    - Laravel is a php based framework. PHP is server side scripting language
    - It follows Model-view-controller architectural pattern and object oriented approach.

    - In the MVC architecture, the model represents the application's data and business logic. The model is responsible for managing data, performing data validation and enforcing business rules. In Laravel, the model is represented by Eloquent, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that allows developers to work with databases using PHP.

    The view is responsible for presenting data to the user in a readable format. The view is typically composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In Laravel, views are generated using Blade, a templating engine that allows developers to build dynamic views with reusable components.

    The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives input from the user and processes it by interacting with the model to retrieve or modify data, and then passes the data to the view for presentation. In Laravel, the controller is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning responses to the client.

    - It has built in authentication and authorization, task scheduling, Eloquent ORM(object realtional model)
        and templating engine

    -   Laravel is a PHP web application framework, which means that it runs on a web server that supports PHP. When a user makes a request to a Laravel application, the web server processes the request and sends it to the Laravel framework for further processing.

        The Laravel framework then uses its routing system to match the incoming request to the appropriate controller method, which contains the logic for handling the request. The controller method may interact with a database or other external services to retrieve or manipulate data, and then return a response to the user.

        Laravel also includes a templating engine called Blade, which allows developers to build dynamic HTML views for their web applications. These views are generated by the server and sent back to the user as part of the response.
