Q. Father of DBMS   

    Edgar Codd was an English computer scientist who, while working for IBM, invented the relational model for database management, the theoretical basis for relational databases and relational database 
    management systems.
    - 1970
    - Earlier it was called SEQUEL (Simple english query language)


- Truncate is faster than delete   
- Truncate deletes all the tuples in one go whereas delete deletes one by one
- Roll back is not possible in truncate because no logs are created whereas it is possible in delete

1.What is SQL?

    Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

    SQL can be divided into several categories of statements:

        DQL-> SELECT
        DDL-> CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME
        DML-> INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
        DCL-> GRANT, REVOKE
        TCl -> COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT

            COMMIT is used to make changes permanent in the database.
            ROLLBACK is used to undo changes in a transaction.
            SAVEPOINT is used to set points within a transaction for later rollback.


2. What are the subsets of SQL or types of SQL commands and briefly explain?

    Data Query Language (DQL): DQL is used for retrieving data from one or more tables in a database.
    Data Definition Language (DDL): DDL is used to define, modify, and manage the structure of the database objects.
    Data Manipulation Language (DML): DML is used for manipulating data within the database.
    Data Control Language (DCL): DCL is used to manage access to the data and database objects.
    Transaction Control Language (TCL): TCL is used to manage transactions in the database.


Q. What is CTE in sql ?

    CTE stands for Common Table Expression in SQL. It's a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs make complex queries more readable and manageable by breaking them down into smaller, modular parts.


3. What is the sequence of execution in SQL?

    from > join > where > group by > having > select > distinct > order by > limit

4. Advantages & disadvantage of SQL

    Advantages

        Faster Query Processing – 
        Large amount of data is retrieved quickly and efficiently. Operations like Insertion, deletion, manipulation of data is also done in almost no time. 
        
        No Coding Skills – 
        For data retrieval, large number of lines of code is not required. All basic keywords such as SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, etc are used and also the syntactical rules are not complex in SQL, which makes it a user-friendly language. 

        Scalability: SQL databases can handle large volumes of data and can be scaled up or down as per the requirements of the application.

        Security: SQL databases have built-in security features that help protect data from unauthorized access, such as user authentication, encryption, and access control.

        Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce data integrity by enforcing constraints such as unique keys, primary keys, and foreign keys, which help prevent data duplication and maintain data accuracy.


        Disadvantages

        Complex Interface – 
        SQL has a difficult interface that makes few users uncomfortable while dealing with the database. 

        Cost – 
        Some versions are costly and hence, programmers cannot access it. 
        
        Partial Control – 
        Due to hidden business rules, complete control is not given to the database. 

        Limited Flexibility: SQL databases are less flexible than NoSQL databases when it comes to handling unstructured or semi-structured data, as they require data to be structured into tables and columns.

        Lack of Real-Time Analytics: SQL databases are designed for batch processing and do not support real-time analytics, which can be a disadvantage for applications that require real-time data processing.


5. What is Database? And how to create a database in SQL?

    a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically through the use of a database management system. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage

    CREATE DATABASE databasename;


6. What is DBMS?

    Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

    Types of DBMS

7. What are Tables and Fields?

    Table:
    A table is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a single record or data entry, while each column represents a specific attribute or piece of information related to those records. Tables provide a way to store and manage structured data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

    Field (Column):
    A field, also referred to as a column, is a single data element within a table. Each column has a unique name and a specific data type that determines the type of information it can hold, such as text, numbers, dates, or binary data. 

8. What are Constraints in SQL?

    SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

    Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

    The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

    NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
    UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
    PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
    FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
    CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
    DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
    CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly


9. What is a primary key and foreign key?

    PRIMARY KEY

        A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique.
        It uniquely identifies a record in the relational database table.
        Only one primary key is allowed in a table.	
        It is a combination of UNIQUE and Not Null constraints.	
        It does not allow NULL values
    
    FOREIGN KEY

        A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables
        It refers to the field in a table which is the primary key of another table.
        Whereas more than one foreign key is allowed in a table.
        It can contain duplicate values and a table in a relational database.
        It can also contain NULL values.

11.What is a "TRIGGER" in SQL?

    An SQL trigger is a database object that is associated with a table and automatically executes a set of SQL statements when a specific event occurs on that table. Triggers are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and automate certain actions within a database.

    The benefits of using SQL triggers include:

    Data integrity: Triggers allow you to enforce complex business rules and constraints at the database level, ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate.

    Automation: Triggers can automate repetitive or complex tasks by executing predefined actions whenever a specified event occurs. This reduces the need for manual intervention and improves efficiency.

    Audit trails: Triggers can be used to track changes made to data, such as logging modifications in a separate audit table. This helps in auditing and maintaining a history of data changes.

    Data validation: Triggers can perform additional validation checks on data before it is inserted, updated, or deleted, ensuring that only valid and conforming data is stored in the database.

    -- Example 1
    Create Trigger before_inser_studentage BEFORE INSERT ON student_age FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
    IF NEW.age < 0 THEN SET NEW.age = 0;
    END IF;
    END 

    --Example 2

    CREATE TRIGGER delete_trigger
    AFTER DELETE ON main_table FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO backup_table (column1, column2, deleted_at)
        VALUES (OLD.column1, OLD.column2, NOW());
    END;


13. What is join in SQL? List its different types.

    A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

    Different types of JOINS in SQL Server
    INNER JOIN
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
    RIGHT OUTER JOIN
    SELF JOIN
    CROSS JOIN


    IN order to give example, we can take customers and orders table

14. What is Normalization in SQL?

    Normalization is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table. Normalization also helps to organize the data in the database. It is a multi-step process that sets the data into tabular form and removes the duplicated data from the relational tables.


15. How to insert a date in SQL?

    SQL Date Data Types

    MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:

    DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
    DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
    TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
    YEAR - format YYYY or YY


17. What are the different types of SQL operators?

    https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_operators.asp

18. What are Aggregate and Scalar functions?    

    Aggregate Functions:

    Aggregate functions operate on a set of values and return a single value that summarizes or calculates information about the set. They are often used with the GROUP BY clause to perform calculations on groups of rows.

    Common aggregate functions include:

    SUM(): Calculates the sum of values in a column.
    AVG(): Calculates the average of values in a column.
    COUNT(): Counts the number of rows in a result set.
    MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a column.
    MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a column.

    Scalar Functions:

    Scalar functions operate on a single value and return a single value. They can be used within SQL expressions to manipulate or transform individual values.

    Common scalar functions include:

    UPPER(): Converts a string to uppercase.
    LOWER(): Converts a string to lowercase.
    CONCAT(): Concatenates two or more strings.
    LENGTH(): Returns the length of a string.
    ROUND(): Rounds a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.

    SELECT ProductName, Price, ROUND(Price, 2) AS RoundedPrice
    FROM Products;

19. What does a window function do in SQL?

    window functions applies aggregate, ranking and analytic functions over a particular window(set of rows)
    ans over clause is used with window function to define that window.

23. What is denormalisation?

    Normalization is the technique of dividing the data into multiple tables to reduce data redundancy and inconsistency and to achieve data integrity. On the other hand, Denormalization is the technique of combining the data into a single table to make data retrieval faster

-- difference between unique and primary key
	-- 	 A unique key allows null values. A primary key does not allow null values. 
    --   A table can have multiple unique keys. A table can have only one primary key.
    --   A unique key can be referenced by foreign keys from other tables.  In fact, foreign keys typically reference the primary key of another table.

# change column -rename the column
# syntax - alter table table_name CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name data_type
alter table bonus CHANGE COLUMN interest saving_interest FLOAT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- OR
 
alter table bonus rename column interest to saving_interest;

# adding primary key
alter table bonus add primary key (bonus_amount);	

# removing primary key
alter table bonus drop primary key;	

# ---------------Joins--------------
-- 	- We set up relations between the tables using foreign key, so to fetch the data from the tables by using those relations , we use Joins.
	-- Joins always returns a table
    -- In order to apply a JOIN operation between two tables in a relational database, there must be a relationship between those tables.


-- Natural Join
NATURAL JOIN
Natural Join in SQL joins two tables based on the same attribute name and datatypes. The resulting table will contain all the attributes of both tables but keep only one copy of each common column.
-- The colmn name should be same.
-- returns the common column one time only
select ename from employee 
Natural Join
department;


-- join is applied on the rows column wise whereas union is applied row wise
	-- columns should be of same type and number in order to apply union, names of the column can be different
    -- Union combines two or more select statements
    -- all the common rows are written once + non matching rows from both the tables

-- view is a type of virtual table in which we can define what columns we want to display.

- It's important to note, that NULL doesn't equal NULL.

    NULL is not a value, and therefore cannot be compared to another value.
    where x is null checks whether x is a null value.
    where x = null is checking whether x equals NULL, which will never be true
