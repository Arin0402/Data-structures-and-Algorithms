# Why Amazon

1. First, I admire how Amazon is largely obsessesd witht the customer. This is something I've experienced first-hand when dealing with Amazon’s customer support. and it's also a principle that I always keep in myu mind while solving any problem like as I did in my last interndship where I end to end delivered the notification system that the helped the users to get updates and because of which the our website engagement also increased by 30%.

“Since the site was hosted on AWS, we tracked engagement using CloudWatch metrics and internal logs. We saw a ~30% increase in daily activity post-deployment of the notification service

2. Second is I am drawn to Amazon because of its strong engineering culture and impact at global scale. I’m excited about to work on high-scale, customer-facing systems and I believe I would get confront to a lot of opportunites at Amazon.

3. Third is, I believe Amazon’s leadership principles — especially ownership, delivering results, and constantly learning — strongly align with how I want to grow as a software engineer.

SO overall Amazon offers the kind of fast-paced, innovative environment where I can challenge myself more deeply and contribute meaningfully to products that impact millions.


# Customer Obsession

# Tell me about a time when you made a decision prioritizing the end user’s needs.
# Tell me about a time you had to go above and beyond for a customer."
    - You went "above and beyond" by making a last-minute, significant pivot based on the judges' feedback
# "Describe a situation where you had to advocate for a customer, even if it meant challenging internal stakeholders or processes."
# How do you ensure you understand customer needs and pain points?"
    - Futures first

# "Tell me about a time you received negative feedback from a customer. How did you handle it?"
    - Jury's feedback

# Describe a time when a customer wanted one thing, but you felt they needed something else. How did you handle that?"
    - Futures first



S – Situation:
During a university hackathon, I was leading a team that was developing an innovative solution to help farmers. We were just an hour away from the final submission deadline, continuolusly  working on enhancing our existing features to present a robust solution.

T – Task:
Just one hour before the final submission, the jury reviewed our prototype and suggested a calculator-like feature that could make our project truly stand out.

A – Action:
Despite being short on time and already working on other enhancements, I evaluated what mattered most to our customers which in this case were the judges . I immediately assessed the situation. My team was already focused on other enhancements, but I understood that we only had time for one major addition before the deadline. I quickly communicated the jury's advice to my team and, despite the tight deadline and our prior roadmap, made the decisive call to pivot.

R – Result:
As a result of it, we were really ablel to impress our judges and won the Hackathon premlims out of 70 partiticpting teams

# Earn Trust / Have Backbone, Disagree and Commit
# Tell me about a time when you resolved a disagreement within a team.

S – Situation:
During the same hackathon, two teammates had a disagreement over how a feature should be implemented. The argument escalated, and their egos were affecting the team spirit.

T – Task:
As the team lead, I had to ensure that our work continued smoothly and that the disagreement didn’t affect our final presentation.

A – Action:
I calmly listened to both sides and acknowledged their views. Then, I brought the conversation back to our main objective — delivering a great product for the judges. I reminded them to focus on our end goal that is to present the prensentation in front of the judges and do what is right for our the project.

R – Result:
We chose the most effective approach and moved ahead as a united team, finishing the project successfully and strengthening our mutual respect.

# Deliver Results
# Describe a time you took ownership of a project and delivered results.

S – Situation:
During my internship at Futures First, which is a trading company, Traders were getting disorganized and need soltion to track the market even when they are not present before the screen 

T – Task:
I had to identify pain points by directly communicating with traders and then build tools that could enhance their performance.

A – Action:
I developed two tools: an alert system for important market events and a churning calculator. I handled everything — from understanding requirements to delivery. I iterated on user feedback regularly to ensure the tools were effective.

R – Result:
One trader used the churning calculator to make a $23,000 profit. The success of these tools showed clear, measurable business impact and helped establish trust in engineering contributions.

# Invent and Simplify
# Tell me about a time you created a solution from scratch.

S – Situation:
At Autodesk, I was workign on a internal application and we wanted to update our customers that is other engineering managers about the latest updates.

T – Task:
I had to create a notification service that informed users of updates in a timely manner.

A – Action:
I designed and developed a notification module from scratch and also performed database remodelling to make the system scalable. I kept the design simple but effective to ensure quick adoption.

R – Result:
After deployment, we saw around a 30% increase in user engagement, as tracked through AWS CloudWatch and internal metrics.

# Bais for action

# Tell me about a time you had to make a high-stakes decision with incomplete information

    You had incomplete information about how perfectly the calculator feature could be implemented in an hour, and what exact impact it would have on the final score. However, you took a calculated risk based on the jury's direct feedback. You prioritized impact over perfect information.

# "Describe a situation where you had to make a quick decision without consulting your team."
    - Hackathon

# "Tell me about a time you made a decision that turned out to be wrong, and what you learned from it

    - Are right a lot
    
    - Overengineered the notificaition service so missed the deadline by 4 days

# Tell me about a time you saw a problem and took the initiative to solve it, even if it wasn't explicitly your responsibility.

    S – Situation:
    During my internship at Autodesk, I was contributing to an internal application used by different teams. While working on my assigned tasks, I noticed that users often missed important updates because there was no system in place to notify them in real-time.

    T – Task:
    Although my main task was limited to a few backend improvements, I realized that the lack of a notification mechanism was hurting user engagement and productivity. No one had specifically asked for this, but I saw it as an opportunity to make a meaningful impact.

    A – Action:
    I took initiative to propose and build a notification service from scratch. I discussed the idea with my manager, aligned it with our goals, and independently designed and implemented the system. I also performed database remodelling to support efficient delivery and tracking of notifications.

    R – Result:
    After deploying the service, we observed a ~30% increase in user engagement, which we tracked using AWS CloudWatch and internal logging systems. Even though it wasn’t part of my initial responsibilities, the feature significantly improved the product experience — and it was later adopted as a standard module in similar internal tools.

# "What's the riskiest decision you've made, and how did you approach it?"

    - Hackathon

    - Situation
    - Task = Now it was my responsibility to make a decisiion of whethrer to continue with our existing imporvements or implement the new feature as if the new feature was not completed on time then it could lead to project incompleteion
    
    - Action
        - I discussed with the team of what matters the most and what out customers wanted (Judges)
    - Result

# "Tell me about a time you made a long-term decision that had a short-term negative impact, but ultimately paid off."

    Situation:
    "During my final year academic project, which involved building a complex web application, our team initially focused heavily on rapidly implementing features to meet tight deadlines. This led to a part of our codebase, specifically a core data processing module, becoming quite convoluted and hard to understand. While functional, I noticed it was becoming increasingly difficult to add new features or fix bugs in this module without breaking something else."

    Task:
    "My immediate task was to continue adding new features to the application. However, I foresaw that this 'spaghetti code' in the data processing module would severely hinder our ability to extend the application in the long run. My task became to convince my teammates and the project mentor that we needed to halt new feature development temporarily and invest time in refactoring this critical module. I knew this decision would cause a short-term delay in delivering new functionality, but was essential for the project's long-term health."

    Action:
    "I took ownership of this problem. I spent extra time analyzing the problematic module, identifying specific areas of inefficiency and inconsistency. I documented how much time we were already losing to debugging issues in this module and projected how much slower future development would be. I then presented my findings to my team and our project mentor, arguing that while it meant pausing work on a highly anticipated front-end feature for about a week, this 'technical cleanup' was a necessary investment.

    I explained that this long-term decision would lead to a cleaner, more modular codebase that would be easier to debug, extend, and even onboard new team members to. I outlined a clear plan for the refactoring, breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Once we collectively agreed, I actively participated in rewriting and optimizing significant parts of that module, ensuring thorough testing to prevent new bugs from being introduced during the process."

    Result:
    "As predicted, the week we dedicated to refactoring meant we missed our internal deadline for the next feature release (the short-term negative impact). However, the long-term payoff was substantial and immediate. Post-refactoring, our team's velocity in adding subsequent features to the application increased by approximately 20-25%. We experienced significantly fewer integration bugs related to that module, and the overall code quality improved, making it much easier for all team members to contribute. This experience taught me the critical importance of balancing immediate deliverables with long-term code health, and having the conviction to advocate for decisions that ensure sustainability and efficiency."

# "How do you ensure accountability for your work?"

    - FF

# Tell me about a time you failed at work. What did you learn from it?

    Situation:
    "During my internship at Autodesk, I was working on creating a notification service. As I was relatively new to the codebase and the specific technologies, I frequently encountered small technical blockers or uncertainties."

    Task:
    "My task was to deliver the notification service efficiently. However, in my eagerness to resolve issues quickly and ensure progress, I developed a habit of immediately approaching my senior colleague whenever I ran into even a minor problem. My implicit task, which I initially failed to recognize, was to not just solve problems, but to develop my own problem-solving capabilities and respect my senior's time."

    Action:
    "My approach at the time was to seek help as soon as I felt stuck, which often meant going to my senior for very trivial issues. This wasn't sustainable, and one day, he directly addressed it, asking me to not come to him for every small issue. This feedback was a crucial moment of realization; I had failed to consider the broader impact of my actions – specifically, monopolizing his valuable time and hindering my own growth.

    After this, I immediately changed my approach. My new process became:

    Independent Research: Before asking for help, I'd dedicate a set amount of time (e.g., 30-60 minutes) to thoroughly research the issue myself using documentation, online resources, and debugging tools.
    Troubleshooting Attempts: I'd try at least 2-3 different potential solutions based on my research.
    Structured Questions: If still stuck, I'd then prepare a concise summary of the problem, what I had already tried, and what specific questions I had, or even suggest a few potential solutions for discussion.            


    Result:
    "This experience was a significant learning moment and a direct example of where my initial approach was wrong. By failing to be self-sufficient and considerate of my senior's time, I learned an invaluable lesson about ownership and effective problem-solving. Post this change, I found I was able to resolve most issues independently, significantly reducing my reliance on my senior.

# Tell me about a challenge you faced. What was your role & the outcome?
    
    S – Situation:
    During my internship at Futures First, I was tasked with developing internal tools to help traders make better and faster decisions. I was expected to interact with the traders directly — something I hadn’t done before — and understand their real-time needs under a high-stakes, fast-paced environment.

    T – Task:
    My challenge was to identify and deliver valuable solutions from scratch, without formal requirements. I had to talk to senior traders, gather requirements, and deliver tools that actually made a measurable impact — all within a short time frame.

    A – Action:
    I initiated multiple conversations with traders, taking the time to understand their pain points and work style. From those discussions, I identified two major gaps:

    Traders were missing important market events, and

    They were manually calculating trade churns, which was inefficient.

    I proposed and developed two separate tools:

    An alert system for market events.

    A churning calculator to automate trade analysis.

    I handled everything — from collecting requirements and designing the tools, to testing and deployment.

    R – Result:
    The tools were a success. One trader made a $23,000 profit using the calculator I built. The alert system also became a part of their daily toolkit. This experience gave me confidence in leading projects independently, solving real problems, and delivering results under pressure.


# Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker/manager/decision

    S – Situation:
    During a college Hackathon, I was leading a team, and we were implementing the final touches of our project — a productivity-focused web app. About an hour before the deadline, a jury member suggested we add a calculator-style feature that could really help our project stand out.

    T – Task:
    At that point, my teammates suggested continuing with the improvements we were already working on, as we had planned them earlier. However, I disagreed with that approach.

    A – Action:
    I believed that adding the calculator feature — although unplanned — would demonstrate responsiveness to feedback and significantly improve our pitch from a customer/judge’s perspective. Even though time was short, I made a case for shifting priorities based on the judges being our end-users. I explained my reasoning, highlighting that this would directly impact how our project was perceived.

    After a quick but thoughtful discussion, the team agreed. I quickly reallocated tasks and took on more work myself to ensure we could build and integrate the new feature in time.

    R – Result:
    We managed to implement the feature just in time. The judges appreciated that we had responded to their suggestion — which helped our project stand out during evaluations. This experience reinforced the importance of speaking up with conviction, especially when the goal is to improve the customer experience.

# Tell me about a time you could not meet a commitment

    S: During my Futures First internship, I committed to delivering a UI update for the alert system within a day.
    T: However, I later discovered an edge case that required more complex handling and testing.
    A: I immediately communicated the issue to my mentor, explained the complexity, and proposed a new timeline with phased delivery.
    R: The team appreciated the transparency. I delivered a bug-free update the next day. I learned that managing expectations early is crucial when priorities shift.

# When you’re working on a team, what roles do you gravitate toward and why?

    S: In team settings, like in our hackathon or during project work, I naturally gravitate toward leadership and coordination roles.
    T: For example, during the hackathon, I was the team lead responsible for assigning work and setting priorities.
    A: I ensured everyone was aligned with their strengths, and when we had only an hour left, I made the final call to pivot to a feature judges wanted.
    R: Our project stood out because of that decision. I gravitate to strategy and problem-solving roles because I enjoy decision-making under pressure.

# Give examples of what you have accomplished in the past, and relate them to what you can achieve in the future

    S: In both of my internships, I delivered full-fledged tools — a notification service at Autodesk and trading tools at Futures First.
    T: These projects involved understanding customer needs, building from scratch, and delivering results that had measurable impact.
    A: I used my technical and interpersonal skills to talk to stakeholders, build what mattered, and keep improving.
    R: These experiences have shaped me into someone who builds customer-focused, reliable systems. At Amazon, I would bring this mindset to solve customer problems at scale.

# Tell me about a time you earned someone’s trust.

    S: At Futures First, I needed trader input for building tools.

    T: Traders were initially hesitant to spend time explaining things.

    A: I asked thoughtful questions, followed up regularly, and showed results quickly.

    R: They began trusting me more and proactively shared insights, improving the project outcome.

# Tell me about a time you were under pressure to deliver.

    S: At Futures First, I had to build and deliver tools for traders in a tight 4-week window.

    T: The tools had to be robust and production-ready.

    A: I prioritized features, focused on user pain points, and kept the stakeholders in loop.

    R: I delivered both tools on time, one of which directly led to $23K profit.
